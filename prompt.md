# Assignment 1

For this assignment you will set up your computer for programming in Javascript and begin exploring the p5.js drawing library.

1. Create an account on Github. Download and install Atom, Chrome, and Github Desktop. 

2. Create a fork of the Assignment 1 repository. Clone the repo to your computer.

3. Visit the [p5js.org reference page](http://p5js.org/reference/), and read the documentation for all of the commands under Color and Shape. Try editing some of the live samples in the documentation.

4. Edit sketch.js to create a program that generates a drawing based on your prompt. Be sure to make occasional commits as your drawing takes shape.

5. Take a screen-grab of your program's output to replace `output.png`. Update `README.md` with the correct URL for your sketch, prompt, and image. 

6. Sync your project in Github Desktop to publish your work to Github.

### Notes

- Create a representational drawing. A representational drawing will pose more of a challenge than an abstract one, pushing you to more deliberate coding. 

- Aim for a fairly complex drawing; this is no place for minimalism. Your program should be at least a couple of pages long.

- Explore the drawing API thoroughly. Use a variety of shapes, styles, and colors. Ideally, use every Color and Shape command in p5.js.

- Consider your composition. Scale, Position, Contrast, Rhythm, Tension, Drama. Create a visually interesting image.
 
- Comment your code clearly. Use comments to create and annotate sections in your code. For this assignment it makes sense to break up your code by what each part draws. 

- Document your work in the `README.md` file. This file is displayed when people view your project repository on Github. Be neat: double check spelling, make sure the link works correctly, take a clean screen-grab, etc. Consider adding some notes to the readme about your code and drawing.

### Grading

Remember the grading policy. Items 1 through 6 are the baseline requirements for the assignment. Merely checking them off is "C" work. For top marks, turn in an interesting take on the assignment. Create well composed image. Write neat, clear, well commented code. Explore the drawing API completely. This assignment is meant as a starting point for learning Javascript and p5, so explore.
